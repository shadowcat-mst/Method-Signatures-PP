=head1 NAME

Method::Signatures::PP - EXPERIMENTAL pure perl method keyword

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Test::More;
    use Method::Signatures::PP;
    
    package Wat;
    
    use Moo;
    
    method foo {
      "FOO from ".ref($self);
    }
    
    method bar ($arg) {
      "WOOO $arg";
    }
    
    package main;
    
    my $wat = Wat->new;
    
    is($wat->foo, 'FOO from Wat', 'Parenless method');
    
    is($wat->bar('BAR'), 'WOOO BAR', 'Method w/argument');
    
    done_testing;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It's ... a method keyword.

    method foo { ... }

is equivalent to

    sub foo { my $self = shift; ... }

and

    method bar ($arg) { ... }

is equivalent to

    method bar ($arg) { my $self = shift; my ($arg) = @_; ... }

In fact, it isn't just equivalent, this module literally rewrites the source
code in the way shown in the examples above. It does so by using a source
filter (boo, hiss, yes I know) to slurp the entire file, then Damian's
wonderfully insane L<PPR> module to parse the code to find the keywords, and
then rewrites the source before returning the file to perl to compile.

The wonderful part of this is that it's 100% pure perl and therefore unlike
every other method implementation is amenable to L<App::FatPacker> use. The
terrible part of this is that if the parse phase doesn't work, the code has
no idea at all what it's doing and ends up not touching the source code at
all, at which point the compilation failures from the keyword rewriting not
having happened will almost certainly hide the actual problem.

So, for the moment, you are strongly advised to not use this module while
developing code, and instead use L<Function::Parameters> if you have a not
completely ancient perl and L<Method::Signatures::Simple> if you're still
back in the stone age banging rocks together, and to then switch your 'use'
line to this module for fatpacking/shipping/etc. - I may yet come up with
a better solution to this and/or beg Damian for help doing so, but at the
time of writing I can offer no guarantees.

Note that L<PPR> requires perl 5.10 and as such so does this module.
